# Email Images Enhancement - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

I've successfully enhanced all your email notification templates to include **listing images and titles** to drive engagement and build trust with users.

### Updated Email Types:
1. ✅ **Outbid Notifications** - Shows the item they're losing
2. ✅ **Time Warnings (1h-48h)** - Reminds them what's ending soon
3. ✅ **Auction Won (Buyer)** - Celebrates their winning item
4. ✅ **Auction Ended (Seller)** - Shows what sold (or didn't)

### Visual Placement:
All emails now have this structure:
```
[Header with emoji and title]
↓
Hi [Name], [personalized message]
↓
┌─────────────────────┐
│   [LISTING IMAGE]   │  ← NEW!
│   Product Title     │  ← NEW!
└─────────────────────┘
↓
[Detailed information table]
↓
[Call-to-action button]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Solution**: 
- Ensure listing has `cover_image_url` set in database

### Email Not Sending?
**Problem**: No emails received  
**Solution**:
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly

### Layout Looks Weird?
**Problem**: Email layout broken in certain clients  
**Solution**:
