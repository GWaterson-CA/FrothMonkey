# ðŸš€ Deploy Auto-Bid Email Notifications Fix

## Quick Start

This fix ensures users only receive outbid emails when their auto-bid limit has been exceeded, preventing email spam during auto-bid increments.

## Prerequisites

âœ… Auto-bid feature is deployed (migrations 038 & 039)  
âœ… Email notifications system is set up  
âœ… Database webhook for notifications is configured

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Supabase CLI (Recommended)**

```bash
cd /Users/geoffreywaterson/Documents/Cursor\ -\ Auction\ Marketplace

# Push all pending migrations
npx supabase db push
```

**Option B: Supabase Dashboard**

1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Open file: `APPLY_AUTO_BID_NOTIFICATION_FIX.sql`
4. Copy and paste the entire contents
5. Click **Run**
6. Verify success message appears

### Step 2: Verify Migration Applied

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check if function was updated
SELECT 
    routine_name, 
    routine_type,
    last_altered
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name = 'notify_bid_placed'
AND routine_schema = 'public';

-- Should show the function with a recent last_altered timestamp
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix

#### Test Scenario 1: Auto-Bid Protection

1. Create a test listing with starting price $20
2. **User A:** Set auto-bid max at $50
   - Should create initial bid at $25
3. **User B:** Place manual bid of $30
   - Auto-bid should counter to $35
   - âœ… **Verify:** User A gets NO email
4. **User B:** Place manual bid of $40
   - Auto-bid should counter to $45
   - âœ… **Verify:** User A gets NO email
5. **User B:** Place manual bid of $60
   - User A cannot counter (exceeds $50 limit)
   - âœ… **Verify:** User A DOES get email

#### Test Scenario 2: No Auto-Bid (Classic Behavior)

1. Use the same test listing
2. **User C:** Place manual bid of $70
3. **User B:** Place manual bid of $80
   - âœ… **Verify:** User C DOES get email (no auto-bid protection)

### Step 4: Monitor Production

After deployment, monitor for:

1. **Email volume** should decrease (fewer unnecessary outbid emails)
2. **User complaints** about email spam should decrease
3. **Email engagement** should increase (only relevant emails sent)

Check with these queries:

```sql
-- Count outbid notifications in last 24 hours
SELECT COUNT(*) as outbid_notifications_24h
FROM notifications 
WHERE type = 'bid_outbid'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Count users with active auto-bids
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as users_with_auto_bid
FROM auto_bids 
WHERE enabled = true;

-- Recent outbid notifications with auto-bid context
SELECT 
    n.created_at,
    n.user_id,
    l.title as listing_title,
    ab.max_amount as auto_bid_max,
    l.current_price
FROM notifications n
JOIN listings l ON l.id = n.listing_id
LEFT JOIN auto_bids ab ON ab.user_id = n.user_id AND ab.listing_id = n.listing_id
WHERE n.type = 'bid_outbid'
AND n.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback to the previous behavior:

```sql
-- Rollback: Notify on every outbid (previous behavior)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_bid_placed()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
DECLARE
    listing_owner UUID;
    listing_title TEXT;
    bidder_name TEXT;
    bid_count INTEGER;
    previous_highest_bid RECORD;
    previous_bidder_name TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Get listing details
    SELECT owner_id, title INTO listing_owner, listing_title
    FROM listings WHERE id = NEW.listing_id;
    
    -- Get bidder name
    SELECT COALESCE(full_name, username, 'A bidder') INTO bidder_name
    FROM profiles WHERE id = NEW.bidder_id;
    
    -- Count total bids on this listing
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO bid_count
    FROM bids WHERE listing_id = NEW.listing_id;
    
    -- Notify seller on first bid
    IF bid_count = 1 THEN
        PERFORM create_notification(
            listing_owner,
            'first_bid_received',
            'First Bid Received!',
            bidder_name || ' placed the first bid of $' || NEW.amount || ' on "' || listing_title || '"',
            NEW.listing_id,
            NEW.bidder_id,
            jsonb_build_object('bid_amount', NEW.amount)
        );
    END IF;
    
    -- Find the previous highest bidder
    SELECT b.bidder_id, b.amount INTO previous_highest_bid
    FROM bids b
    WHERE b.listing_id = NEW.listing_id 
        AND b.bidder_id != NEW.bidder_id
        AND b.id != NEW.id
    ORDER BY b.amount DESC, b.created_at ASC
    LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Notify previous highest bidder (every time)
    IF FOUND THEN
        SELECT COALESCE(full_name, username, 'Another bidder') INTO previous_bidder_name
        FROM profiles WHERE id = previous_highest_bid.bidder_id;
        
        PERFORM create_notification(
            previous_highest_bid.bidder_id,
            'bid_outbid',
            'You''ve Been Outbid!',
            'Your bid of $' || previous_highest_bid.amount || ' on "' || listing_title || '" has been outbid',
            NEW.listing_id,
            NEW.bidder_id,
            jsonb_build_object('previous_bid', previous_highest_bid.amount, 'new_bid', NEW.amount)
        );
    END IF;
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Function not found after migration
- **Solution:** Check that migration 040 is in the migrations table
- **Verify:** `SELECT * FROM _migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 5;`

**Issue:** Still receiving emails during auto-bid increments
- **Solution:** Check that auto-bid is enabled for the user
- **Verify:** `SELECT * FROM auto_bids WHERE user_id = '[USER_ID]' AND listing_id = '[LISTING_ID]';`

**Issue:** Not receiving ANY outbid emails
- **Solution:** Check email webhook is configured
- **Verify:** Go to Database > Webhooks in Supabase Dashboard
