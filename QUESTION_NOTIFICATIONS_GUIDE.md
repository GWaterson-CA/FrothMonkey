# Q&A Email Notifications Implementation Guide

## üéâ Overview

This feature adds email notifications for the Questions & Answers functionality on listings. Users will now receive beautiful, branded emails when:

1. **Seller receives a question** - When a user asks a question on their listing
2. **User's question is answered** - When the seller answers their question

---

## üì¶ What Was Implemented

### 1. Email Templates (`lib/email/templates.tsx`)

**New Templates Added:**
- ‚úâÔ∏è **QuestionReceivedEmail** - Notifies seller when someone asks a question
- ‚úâÔ∏è **QuestionAnsweredEmail** - Notifies user when their question is answered

Both templates feature:
- FrothMonkey logo and branding
- Listing image preview
- Question text displayed prominently
- Answer text (for answered notifications)
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Direct links to listings

### 2. Email Service (`lib/email/send-notification-email.ts`)

**Updates:**
- Added imports for new email templates
- Added cases for `question_received` and `question_answered` notification types
- Updated preference mapping to include new notification types

### 3. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/041_question_email_notifications.sql`)

**What it does:**
- Adds `question_answered` to the notification types constraint
- Creates `notify_question_answered()` function
- Creates trigger to automatically send notifications when questions are answered
- Updates `notify_question_received()` function to include asker name in metadata
- Updates notification preferences for all existing users
- Sets default preferences for new users

**Functions:**
- `notify_question_received()` - Triggers when a question is created (updated)
- `notify_question_answered()` - Triggers when a question is answered (new)

**Triggers:**
- `trigger_notify_question_received` - Already exists, updated metadata
- `trigger_notify_question_answered` - New trigger on `auction_questions` UPDATE

### 4. Edge Function (`supabase/functions/send-notification-emails/index.ts`)

**Updates:**
- Added `question_received` and `question_answered` to `emailableTypes` array
- Added preference checks for new notification types
- Added HTML email templates for both notification types
- Metadata handling for question text, answer text, and user names

SELECT 
    n.id,
    n.type,
    n.title,
    n.message,
    n.created_at,
    n.read_at,
    p.username as recipient,
    l.title as listing_title
FROM notifications n
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = n.user_id
LEFT JOIN listings l ON l.id = n.listing_id
WHERE n.type IN ('question_received', 'question_answered')
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Emails not being sent

**Possible causes:**
1. User has disabled email notifications
2. User has disabled specific notification type
3. Resend API key not configured
4. Edge function not deployed

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check user preferences
SELECT 
    username,
    notification_preferences->>'email_notifications' as email_enabled,
    notification_preferences->>'question_received' as question_received,
    notification_preferences->>'question_answered' as question_answered
FROM profiles
WHERE username = 'username_here';

-- Check edge function logs
-- Go to Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > send-notification-emails > Logs
```

### Issue: Notifications created but no emails

**Check:**
1. Edge function webhook is configured
2. Edge function has RESEND_API_KEY set
3. Check edge function logs for errors

### Issue: Wrong user receiving notification

**Check:**
1. Verify listing ownership
2. Check questioner_id in auction_questions
3. Review notification user_id
