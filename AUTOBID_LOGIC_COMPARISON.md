# Auto-bid Logic Comparison: Before vs After

## The Key Change

The only change is in the ORDER BY clause when selecting which auto-bid to process next.

### Before Fix

```sql
SELECT ab.* INTO v_auto_bid_record
FROM auto_bids ab
WHERE ab.listing_id = p_listing_id
  AND ab.enabled = true
  AND ab.user_id != v_current_highest_bidder
  AND ab.max_amount >= v_required_min
ORDER BY 
  ab.max_amount DESC,        -- Always select highest max
  ab.created_at ASC          -- Tiebreaker by time
LIMIT 1;
```

**Logic:** "Pick the auto-bid with the highest maximum amount"

### After Fix

```sql
SELECT ab.* INTO v_auto_bid_record
FROM auto_bids ab
WHERE ab.listing_id = p_listing_id
  AND ab.enabled = true
  AND ab.user_id != v_current_highest_bidder
  AND ab.max_amount >= v_required_min
ORDER BY 
  -- Priority 1: If at max, prioritize earliest
  CASE WHEN ab.max_amount = v_required_min THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  -- Priority 2: Among users at max, earliest wins
  CASE WHEN ab.max_amount = v_required_min THEN ab.created_at END ASC,
  -- Priority 3: Otherwise, highest max wins
  ab.max_amount DESC, 
  -- Priority 4: Tiebreaker by time
  ab.created_at ASC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Logic:** "If anyone is at their max, they go first (earliest wins). Otherwise, pick highest max."

## Complete Bidding Example

### Setup
- **Listing:** Starts at $20
- **User A:** Sets auto-bid to $25 at 10:00:00 AM
- **User B:** Sets auto-bid to $30 at 10:00:05 AM (5 seconds later)
- **Bid Increment:** $1

### ❌ OLD BEHAVIOR (Incorrect)

| Step | Required Min | User A Max | User B Max | Selected | Bid Amount | Winner | Why |
|------|--------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|--------|-----|
| 1 | $21 | $25 ✓ | - | User A | $21 | User A | User A sets autobid first |
| 2 | $22 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | User B | $22 | User B | $30 > $25 (highest max) |
| 3 | $23 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | User A | $23 | User A | $30 > $25 (highest max) |
| 4 | $24 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | User B | $24 | User B | $30 > $25 (highest max) |
| 5 | $25 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | **User B** | **$25** | **User B** | ❌ **$30 > $25 (User A loses at their max!)** |
| DONE | - | $25 max | $30 max | - | - | User B @ $25 | User B never needed to bid $26+ |

**Problem:** User B wins at $25 even though User A wanted to pay $25 (and committed first)

### ✅ NEW BEHAVIOR (Correct)

| Step | Required Min | User A Max | User B Max | Selected | Bid Amount | Winner | Why |
|------|--------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|--------|-----|
| 1 | $21 | $25 ✓ | - | User A | $21 | User A | User A sets autobid first |
| 2 | $22 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | User B | $22 | User B | Neither at max, $30 > $25 |
| 3 | $23 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | User A | $23 | User A | Neither at max, $30 > $25 |
| 4 | $24 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | User B | $24 | User B | Neither at max, $30 > $25 |
| 5 | $25 | $25 ✓ | $30 ✓ | **User A** | **$25** | **User A** | ✅ **User A at max, gets priority!** |
| 6 | $26 | $25 ✗ | $30 ✓ | User B | $26 | User B | Only User B can still bid |
| DONE | - | $25 max | $30 max | - | - | User B @ $26 | Fair outcome |

**Benefit:** User A got their $25 bid, User B still wins but at $26

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case 1: Both Users at Same Max (Tie)

**Setup:**
- User A: max $50 (created first)
- User B: max $50 (created second)
- Required min: $50

**Result:** User A wins (earliest created_at breaks the tie)

### Case 2: User Increases Their Max

**Setup:**
- User A: max $25 (created at 10:00:00)
- User B: max $30 (created at 10:00:05)
- User A increases to $35 (updated at 10:00:10)

**At $30:**
- User B gets $30 (they committed to it first at 10:00:05)
- User A counters at $31

### Case 3: Three Competing Bidders

**Setup:**
- User A: max $25
- User B: max $30
- User C: max $28

**At $25:**
- User A bids $25 (at their max)
- User C bids $26 (highest remaining: $28 > $26)
- User B bids $27 (highest remaining: $30 > $27)
- User C bids $28 (at their max)
- User B bids $29 (only one left)

**Result:** User B wins at $29

## Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **User A gets their max bid?** | ❌ No ($24) | ✅ Yes ($25) |
| **Fair to earliest bidder?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Final price** | $25 | $26 |
| **Seller revenue** | Lower | Higher |
| **User B still wins?** | Yes | Yes |
| **User B pays more?** | No | Yes (+$1) |

**Winner:** Everyone benefits except the highest bidder pays $1 more (which is fair since they still win)
