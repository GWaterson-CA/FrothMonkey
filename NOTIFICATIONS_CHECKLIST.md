# Notification System - Setup Checklist

Complete these steps in order to activate the notification system.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Pre-Flight Check

- [ ] You have access to your Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] You can run Supabase CLI commands (or use SQL Editor)
- [ ] Your app is running locally for testing

## üìã Setup Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations

**Using Supabase CLI (Recommended):**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
supabase db push
```

**Or Using Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/023_notifications_system.sql`
4. Run the query
5. Repeat for `supabase/migrations/024_schedule_time_notifications.sql`

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Run this in SQL Editor to verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications;
-- Should return 0 (table exists but is empty)

SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%notify%';
-- Should show 5 triggers
```

- [ ] Migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Triggers created
- [ ] Functions exist

---

### Step 2: Enable Realtime

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
3. Find `notifications` table in the list
4. Toggle it **ON**

4. Click **"Create a new cron job"**
5. Fill in:
   - **Job name:** `time_warning_notifications`
   - **Schedule:** `0 * * * *`
   - **Query:** `SELECT schedule_time_notifications();`
6. Click **"Create"**

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check if cron job exists
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'time_warning_notifications';
-- Should return one row
```

- [ ] Cron job created and enabled

---

### Step 4: Test the System

#### Test 1: Question Notification
1. Log in as **User A**
2. Create a test listing
3. Log in as **User B** (different browser/incognito)
4. Ask a question on User A's listing
5. Switch back to User A ‚Üí **Check for notification bell badge**

- [ ] Seller received "Question Received" notification

#### Test 2: First Bid Notification
1. As **User B**, place a bid on the listing
2. Switch to **User A** ‚Üí **Check notifications**

- [ ] Seller received "First Bid Received" notification

#### Test 3: Outbid Notification
1. Log in as **User C**
2. Place a higher bid on the same listing
3. Switch to **User B** ‚Üí **Check notifications**

- [ ] Previous bidder received "Outbid" notification

#### Test 4: Reserve Met Notification
1. As **User A**, edit listing to add a reserve price (e.g., $50)
2. Ensure current bid is below reserve
3. As **User C**, place bid above reserve price
4. Check notifications for:
   - **User A** (seller)
   - **User B** (has bid on listing)

- [ ] Seller received "Reserve Met" notification
- [ ] Bidders received "Reserve Met" notification

#### Test 5: Time Warnings (Manual Test)
```sql
-- Manually trigger time warnings
SELECT create_time_warning_notifications();
-- Check result: should return number of notifications created
```

- [ ] Function runs without errors
- [ ] Creates notifications for auctions ending in 24h/2h

#### Test 6: Listing Ended Notification
1. Create a short test listing (ends in 1 minute)
2. Wait for it to end
3. Run finalize function:
```sql
SELECT finalize_auctions();
```
4. Check notifications for seller

- [ ] Seller received "Listing Ended" notification

### Step 5: Verify UI Components

1. **Header Bell Icon:**
   - [ ] Bell icon visible when logged in
   - [ ] Badge shows correct unread count
   - [ ] Clicking opens dropdown with recent notifications
   - [ ] "Mark all as read" button works

2. **Notifications Dropdown:**
   - [ ] Shows 10 most recent notifications

### Step 6: Performance Check

Run these queries to ensure indexes are working:

```sql
-- Should be fast (< 10ms for small datasets)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Should use index
EXPLAIN ANALYZE 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications 
WHERE user_id = 'some-user-id' 
AND read_at IS NULL;
```

- [ ] Queries use indexes
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
