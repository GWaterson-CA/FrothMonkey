# Auto-bid Max Priority Fix - Quick Summary

## Problem
When User A auto-bids to $25 and User B auto-bids to $30, User B was getting the $25 bid even though User A committed to that amount first. This was unfair to User A and resulted in lower final prices.

## Solution
Modified the `process_auto_bids()` function to give priority to users when the required bid amount equals their maximum. Now User A gets the $25 bid, and User B counters at $26.

## Impact
- ✅ **Fairer for bidders**: Users always get to place their maximum bid
- ✅ **Better for sellers**: Final prices may be $1-2 higher in competitive scenarios  
- ✅ **No breaking changes**: All existing auto-bids continue to work

## How to Deploy

### Quick Deploy
```bash
./DEPLOY_AUTOBID_MAX_PRIORITY_FIX.sh
```

### Manual Deploy
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Test
```bash
psql -f TEST_AUTOBID_MAX_PRIORITY.sql
```

## Example

**Before (Incorrect):**
- Price: $20
- User A auto-bids $25 (first)
- User B auto-bids $30 (second)
- Result: User B wins at $25 ❌

**After (Correct):**
- Price: $20
- User A auto-bids $25 (first)
- User B auto-bids $30 (second)  
- Result: User A bids $25, User B counters at $26 ✅

4. `DEPLOY_AUTOBID_MAX_PRIORITY_FIX.sh` - Deploy script

## What Changed
Only one function was modified: `process_auto_bids()`

The ORDER BY clause now prioritizes users at their max amount:
```sql
-- Old: Always pick highest max
ORDER BY ab.max_amount DESC, ab.created_at ASC

-- New: Prioritize users at their max, then highest max
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN ab.max_amount = v_required_min THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  CASE WHEN ab.max_amount = v_required_min THEN ab.created_at END ASC,
  ab.max_amount DESC, 
  ab.created_at ASC
```

## Safety
- ✅ No data structure changes
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Can be rolled back safely
- ✅ No impact on completed auctions
