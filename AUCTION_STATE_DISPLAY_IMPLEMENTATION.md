October 14, 2025

## Key Features

### Active Listings Display

### Finished Listings Display
- ✅ Shows "Final price" instead of "Current bid"
- ✅ Displays bid count: "3 bids placed", "15 bids placed", etc.
- ✅ Shows "Sold for $XXX" for listings with bids
- ✅ Shows "No bids placed" for listings without bids
- ✅ "Auction ended" badge for recently ended items

### Recently Finished Auctions Section
- ✅ Special section showing auctions ended within last 12 hours
- ✅ Provides social proof and pricing insights
- ✅ Same display format as other finished listings

## Files Modified

### Core Components
1. **`components/listing-card.tsx`**
   - Added `bid_count` prop to listing interface
   - Updated display logic to show different info based on auction state
   - Changed "Current bid" to "Final price" for ended auctions
   - Added bid count display for finished listings
   - Shows "Sold for" message for successful auctions

2. **`components/listings-grid.tsx`**
   - Updated all queries to fetch bid counts via related table join
   - Added `bids!listing_id (id)` to all SELECT queries
   - Passes computed bid count to ListingCard component
   - Applies to all filter types: ending-soon, newly-listed, reserve-met

3. **`components/recently-finished-auctions.tsx`**
   - Updated to pass bid count from fetched data
   - Handles both `bidCount` and `bids` array formats

### Account Pages
4. **`app/account/listings/page.tsx`**
   - Updated user's own listings display
   - Shows bid count for ended listings
   - Format: "X bids placed • Sold for $XXX"
   - Already fetches bids, enhanced display logic

5. **`app/account/watchlist/page.tsx`**
   - Added bids to query
   - Updated display for favorited listings
   - Shows bid count and final price for ended auctions
   - Maintains time remaining for active listings

## Display Logic

### Active Auction Card
```

Live Badge

Title
Current bid: $500
Location
Listing ends in 2h 45m
```

### Finished Auction Card
```

Auction ended Badge

Title
Final price: $750
Location
3 bids placed
Sold for $750
```

### No Bids Finished Auction
```

Auction ended Badge

Title
Final price: $100
Location
No bids placed
```

## Database Queries

All listing queries now include:
```sql
bids!listing_id (
  id
)
```

Bid count is calculated client-side:
```typescript
bid_count: Array.isArray(listing.bids) ? listing.bids.length : 0
```

## Social Proof Strategy

### Why Show Bid Counts on Finished Listings?
1. **Transparency**: Shows market activity and item popularity
2. **Pricing Insights**: Helps users understand what similar items sell for
3. **Platform Credibility**: Demonstrates active marketplace
4. **Learning Tool**: New users see typical bid activity levels

### Why Hide Bid Counts on Active Listings?
1. **Urgency Focus**: Emphasizes time remaining over competition
2. **Reduces Hesitation**: Users less likely to be intimidated
3. **Cleaner UI**: Less information clutter during decision-making
4. **Encourages Action**: Focus on "act now" not "others are bidding"

## Recently Finished Section
- Shows listings ended within last 24 hours
- Currently implemented with 12-hour window in listings-grid
- Provides social proof without cluttering active listings
- Helps with empty state when no active auctions

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Active listings show countdown timer
- [x] Active listings do NOT show bid count
- [x] Finished listings show bid count
- [x] Finished listings show "Sold for" price
- [x] Recently finished section displays correctly
- [x] Account pages show correct information
- [x] Watchlist/favorites pages updated
- [x] TypeScript types updated
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Build completes successfully

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Hover States**: Show bid count on hover for active listings?
2. **Bid History Link**: Direct link to full bid history on finished auctions
3. **Time Window Toggle**: Allow users to filter by recently finished time range
4. **Trending Indicators**: Show "Hot" badge for high bid count finished items
5. **Comparison Tool**: Compare finished auction prices in same category

### Performance Considerations
- Current implementation adds minimal overhead
- Bid count is retrieved via join (single query)
- Consider caching for very high-traffic scenarios
- Monitor query performance with growing bid table

## Notes
- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- Uses existing `bids` table relationship
- Gracefully handles missing bid data
- Works with existing favorites system
- Compatible with category filtering
- Supports search functionality
