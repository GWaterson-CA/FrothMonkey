-- VERIFY CRON JOB AND AUTOMATION IS WORKING
-- ===========================================
-- Run this script to verify your auction finalization automation

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 1: Verify Cron Job Exists and is Active
-- ===========================================
SELECT 
    '‚úÖ CRON JOB STATUS' as check_type,
    jobid,
    jobname,
    schedule,
    command,
    CASE 
        WHEN active THEN '‚úÖ Active'

-- If no results, cron job doesn't exist!

        ELSE '‚úÖ Cron job exists'
    END as status
FROM cron.job
WHERE jobname = 'finalize-auctions'
   OR command LIKE '%finalize_auctions%';

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 2: Check for Stuck Auctions (Should be 0)
-- ===========================================
SELECT 
    'üìä STUCK AUCTIONS CHECK' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as stuck_count,
    CASE 
        WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN '‚úÖ No stuck auctions - automation working!'
        WHEN COUNT(*) > 0 THEN '‚ö†Ô∏è ' || COUNT(*) || ' auctions need finalization'
        ELSE '‚úÖ Good'
    END as status

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 3: Manually Test the Function
-- ===========================================
-- Run this to manually trigger finalization (for testing)
-- This simulates what the cron job does
SELECT 
    'üß™ MANUAL TEST' as check_type,
    finalize_auctions() as auctions_finalized,

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 4: Check Recent Status Changes
-- ===========================================
-- This shows listings that were recently finalized (in last hour)

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 5: Check Cron Job Execution History
-- ===========================================
-- Check if cron job has been running (if available)

    runid,

WHERE jobid IN (

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 6: Verify Notifications Are Being Created
-- ===========================================
-- Check if notifications were created for finalized listings
SELECT 
    'üîî RECENT NOTIFICATIONS' as check_type,
    COUNT(*) as notification_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT listing_id) as listings_with_notifications

FROM notifications
WHERE type IN ('listing_ended_seller', 'auction_won')
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 7: Create Test Listing (Optional)
-- ===========================================
-- Uncomment this to create a test listing that ends in 2 minutes
-- This is useful for end-to-end testing
/*
INSERT INTO listings (
    owner_id,
    title,
    description,
