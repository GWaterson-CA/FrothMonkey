### 2. TypeScript Types
**File**: `lib/database.types.ts`
- Updated `auction_questions` interface to include `answer_images: string[] | null`

### 5. API Endpoint Enhancement

## User Flow

## Technical Details

### Image Storage
- Bucket: `listing-images` (existing)
- Format: JPEG (compressed from any image format)
- Max dimension: 800px
- Max file size: 5MB (before compression, ~500KB after)
- Path structure: `{listing_id}/{filename}.jpg`

### Database Structure
```sql
-- auction_questions table
answer_images TEXT[] NULL  -- Array of image paths
```

### API Request Format
```typescript
PATCH /api/questions/{id}/answer
{
  "answer": "Your answer text",
  "image_paths": ["listing-id/image1.jpg", "listing-id/image2.jpg"]
}
```

### Data Flow
1. User uploads images → Compressed → Uploaded to Supabase Storage
2. Paths returned → Stored in state
3. Submit answer → Paths sent to API
4. API saves paths to `answer_images` column
5. API adds images to `listing_images` table
6. Success response → UI refreshes

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Apply database migration
- [ ] Test image upload (single image)

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Migration**: Run the SQL migration in your Supabase dashboard or via CLI
2. **Test Feature**: Answer a question with images on a test listing
3. **Monitor**: Check server logs for any errors
4. **Optimize**: Consider adding image lightbox for better UX (future enhancement)

## Notes
