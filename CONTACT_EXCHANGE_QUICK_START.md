# Contact Exchange - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Built

A complete contact exchange and messaging system that automatically connects buyers and sellers after auctions end.

## Key Features

âœ… **Automatic Contact Sharing** - When reserve is met, contacts are automatically shared
âœ… **Approval System** - Sellers can approve/decline if reserve isn't met  
âœ… **Short Messaging** - Built-in messaging for sharing delivery details, phone numbers, etc.
âœ… **Integrated UI** - New "Contact Exchanges" tab in My Listings and My Bids
âœ… **Notifications** - Users are notified at each step of the process
âœ… **Secure** - Full RLS policies protect user privacy

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Apply Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/geoffreywaterson/Documents/Cursor\ -\ Auction\ Marketplace
supabase db push
```

This creates:
- `auction_contacts` table
- `auction_messages` table  
- 3 new database functions
- All RLS policies

### 2. Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test It!

**As a Seller:**
1. Go to Account â†’ My Listings â†’ Contact Exchanges tab
2. You'll see any ended auctions with contact exchange requests
3. Click "Approve" or "Decline" for pending requests
4. Use "Show Messages" to chat with buyers

**As a Buyer:**
1. Go to Account â†’ My Bids â†’ Contact Exchanges tab
2. View contact exchanges for auctions you won or bid on
3. Wait for seller approval (if reserve not met)
4. Use "Show Messages" to chat with sellers

## How It Works

### Reserve Met or No Reserve
```
Auction Ends â†’ Contact Exchange Auto-Created (approved)
             â†’ Both parties notified
             â†’ Messaging immediately available
```

### Reserve NOT Met
```
Auction Ends â†’ Contact Exchange Created (pending_approval)
             â†’ Seller notified to approve/decline
             â†’ Seller Approves â†’ Both parties notified â†’ Messaging available
             â†’ Seller Declines â†’ Buyer notified â†’ No messaging
```
