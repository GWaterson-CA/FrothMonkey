# Email Templates Enhancement - Listing Images & Titles

## Overview
Updated email notification templates to include **listing images and titles** to drive user engagement and build trust. These visual elements are strategically placed above the listing details to create immediate recognition and urgency.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Outbid Notification Email**
- âœ… Added listing cover image (400px max width, responsive)
- âœ… Added prominent listing title below the image
- âœ… Positioned above the bid comparison table
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Create FOMO (fear of missing out) and encourage immediate action

### 2. **Time Warning Emails** (1h, 2h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h)
- âœ… Added listing cover image
- âœ… Added prominent listing title
- âœ… Positioned above the auction details
- âœ… Different color scheme (orange) to signal urgency
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Build urgency and remind users of the specific item they're bidding on

### 3. **Auction Won Email** (Buyer)
- âœ… Added listing cover image
- âœ… Added prominent listing title
- âœ… Positioned above the winning details
- âœ… Green success color scheme
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Create excitement and satisfaction, encourage next steps

### 4. **Auction Ended Email** (Seller)
- âœ… Added listing cover image
- âœ… Added prominent listing title
- âœ… Positioned above the sale details
- âœ… Conditional color scheme (green for sold, gray for unsold)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Provide clear confirmation and next steps

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching
```typescript
// Now fetches cover_image_url along with title and price
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('listings')
  .select('id, title, current_price, cover_image_url')
  .eq('id', notification.listing_id)
  .single()

const listingImage = listingData?.cover_image_url || `${appUrl}/placeholder-image.jpg`
```

### Email Template Structure
Each email now includes a "listing preview" section:
```html
<div class="listing-preview">
  <img src="${listingImage}" alt="${listingTitle}" class="listing-image" />
  <h2 class="listing-title">${listingTitle}</h2>
</div>
```

### Styling
- **Responsive**: Images scale down on mobile devices
- **Professional**: 8px border radius, centered alignment
- **Accessible**: Alt text for images, semantic HTML
- **Fallback**: Placeholder image if listing image missing
